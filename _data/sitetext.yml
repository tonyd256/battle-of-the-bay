    donationtitle: "Please Donate to Wildfire Relief"
    donationtext: >
      Wildfires have been ravaging our wilderness area and wild urban interface regions across Northern California and beyond. Thousands of people have been evacuated from or even lost their homes, and aren't sure when they'll be able to return. Even here in the Bay Area, our beloved Big Basin and our route, the Skyline to Sea, succumbed to one of the fires and it will take a long time for it to recover.<br><br>

      As the air clears and we return to enjoying our other outdoor spaces on the Battle of the Bay circuit, we ask you to please consider donating a set amount for every route you tackle. Here are two funds that are doing great work to help families impacted by the fires across Norcal.<br><br>

      We ask you to pick a set amount (maybe the cost of a race entry: $10, $50, $100, whatever you're able to spare) and each time you finish one of our BOTB routes, donate that amount to one of these organizations.

      In these challenging times of COVID-19, we’ve seen a lot of our goal races cancelled across the Bay Area and beyond. But with this lapse in travelling and a race schedule, we have an opportunity. Let’s get out to explore our own spectacular backyard and parts of the Bay Area we don’t usually run. And hey, there’s no harm in making a little team competition out of it, right?<br><br>

      So we present to you “The Battle of the Bay [FKT](https://fastestknowntime.com/) Challenge”.  From Aug 1-Dec 31, the four regions of the Bay Area will battle it out for the fastest times across several beautiful Bay Area running routes. Each region (San Francisco, East Bay, North Bay, South Bay/Peninsula) has one short (<10 miles) & one long segment (>10 miles).<br><br>

      Come the end of December, we’ll have prizes for the following categories from our supporters [GU Energy Labs](https://www.instagram.com/guenergylabs/), [San Francisco Running Company](https://www.instagram.com/sfrunco/) and [Equator Coffees](https://www.equatorcoffees.com/):<br>
        - **The Grand Slam:** prize is awarded to any individual to complete all 8 routes throughout the competition<br>
        - **The Best of the Bay:** the region that finishes with the highest number of the 16 FKTs (8 routes, male and female) at the end of the competition period on Dec 31<br>
        - **The Goats:** The Goats: we’ll have four prizes (male and female) for the fastest combined time for: 1) all four long routes, and 2) all four short routes<br>
        - **The Backyard Explorers:** that region that finishes with the highest number of segment completions regardless of time

    title: Rules & Guidelines
    text: |
      - You can attempt and submit as many segment times as you like. Get out there. Get after it.
      - All attempts at the route need to be run in the 5 months between **August 1st** and **December 31th**.
      - When you submit your first time, you sign up for your team (**North Bay, South Bay/Peninsula, East Bay, San Francisco**). We’re not going to hound you about legalities on which team you join. If you live in SF, but your heart and friends are in Marin, by all means join the North Bay. Once you submit your first segment and claim your team, that’s your team for the competition.
      - We prefer if you share a Strava link (or link from another appropriate app), but if you only use a Casio, put in your true time. We trust you. Please don’t betray that trust.
      - However, the **total elapsed time** is the time that you should submit, i.e. the time it took you to get from start to finish. Sorry Strava, but moving time isn't real. And let's all stop stopping our watches at the traffic lights. We're still on a run and are only lying to ourselves ;-)
      - Tell us about how your new routes are going. On your social media posts, use the hashtag **#battleofthebayFKT** on your favourite photos or stories from the route.
      - Carry a **mask/buff** with you at all times. It’s common courtesy to pull your mask up as you encounter people on the trail. We’re all in this together. Let’s protect each other.
      - Feel free to join our [Strava club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/713705) to follow and chat with other participants.
