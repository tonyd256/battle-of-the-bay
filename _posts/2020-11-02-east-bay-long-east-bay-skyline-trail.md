The longest of our routes and one of the most under-rated, yet iconic gems of
Northern California. The East Bay Skyline National Trail traverses the ridge
line above the coastal mountains situated to the east of Richmond, Berkeley and
Oakland; and ends in Castro Valley. It goes entirely through the East Bay
Regional Park system; Wildcat Canyon, Tilden, Sibley, Huckleberry, Redwood and
the two Chabot parks. This is the eastern portion of the yet-to-be-completed Bay
Area Ridge Trail. For added fun, why not take the BART public transport to the
start and from the finish. It’ll just cost you an extra few street
miles.

As it stands, Devon Yanko and Lucy Andrews share the women’s CR (5:28:51) and
Paddy O’Leary holds the fastest male time (4:18:08)
