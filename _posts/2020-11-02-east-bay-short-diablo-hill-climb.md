Mount Diablo. A burly and beautiful beast of a mountain. This route takes you on
the north side of Diablo on lovely sustained single track over Eagle Peak, Bald
Ridge, Prospector’s Gap to the summit. After your CR attempt, coast down Juniper
trail and Meridian Ridge fireroad for a 13 mile round trip, or if you’re feeling
spicy, tag on North Peak and Olympia Peak for the 4 peaks of Diablo.

As it stands, Devon Yanko (1:28:08) and Yuri Gonzaga (1:13:52) hold the CRs for
the Eagle-Diablo hill climb ([Strava](https://www.strava.com/segments/24874946),
