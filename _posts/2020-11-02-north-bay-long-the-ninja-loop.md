This route's tradition goes back several years to when a few ultra-runners
decided to sneak in a trail run into the early morning hours before working in
the city (hence the Ninja). This route hits many of the best trails in southern
Marin and as you move around, youâ€™ll have spectacular views of the city, the
ocean and Mount Tamalpais.

As it stands, Devon Yanko (1:24:40) and Matt Leach (1:11:16) have the [Strava
CRs](https://www.strava.com/segments/5463709).

**Start Location:** Start at the (west) Parking Lot on the Marin side of the Golden Gate Bridge<br>
**Distance:** 11.5 miles<br>
**Elevation Gain:** 2100ft
