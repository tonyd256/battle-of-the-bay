The pride and joy of Marin mountain runners - The Mount Tam Hill Climb. The
road, the rut, the switchbacks and the scramble all bring their own unique pain
to this route. We would recommend checking this one off early in the morning. A
sunrise over an Karl the Fog inversion is a sight to behold. And a quick tip for
you. You may want to scope out the scramble. It has been the thorn of many a CR
attempt.

As it stands, Marin’s YiOu Wang (38:30) and out-of-towner Jim Walmsley (30:38)
have the [Strava CRs](https://www.strava.com/segments/2176386) ([FKT
boards](https://fastestknowntime.com/route/mt-tamalpais-ca)).

**Start Location:** Start at the clock tower by the Mill Valley Depot. Don’t stop your watch til you touch the East Peak door.<br>
**Distance:** 3.3 miles<br>
**Elevation Gain:**  2500ft
