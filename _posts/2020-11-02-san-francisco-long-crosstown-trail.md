The Crosstown Trail is a 17-mile route connecting San Francisco neighborhoods,
open spaces, and other major trails. It runs from Candlestick Point in the
southeast corner of the city to Lands End in the northwest corner. With a great
mixture of trails, stairs and city streets, this is a gem of a route on the Bay
Area running scene. To find out exact route details, go to
