Running from the Rainbow Flag on Market Street to the top of the iconic Mount
Sutro, this route mixes the relentless 17th street climb and the Historic Trail
singletrack through the blissful eucalyptus forest of Mount Sutro Open Space
Reserve. Be careful at the top, the routeâ€™s not over until you reach the park
bench. For good measure, pop over to Sutro Tower and Twin Peaks on your cooldown
to see some great city panoramas.

As it stands, THE Laura Green (18:53) and her honorary son Paddy O'Leary (14:03)
have the [Strava CRs](https://www.strava.com/segments/24898541).

**Start Location:** Pink Triangle Park at the bottom of 17th Street<br>
**Distance:** 1.7 miles<br>
**Elevation Gain:** 700ft
