Unfortunately the CZU Lightning Complex fires destroyed many of the trails in
Big Basin Redwoods State Park, so the original Skyline to Sea route will be out
of commission for the timebeing ([All
Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/skyline-to-the-sea-trail-saratoga-gap-route)).
However, we encourage you to try our alternate route, The South Bay Skyline, and
also to donate if you can to the Fire Relief charities we mentioned
above.

The new South Bay/Peninsula long course is one that will particularly whet the
appetite of the ultrarunners around. We came across the South Bay Skyline route
when Jordi Moncada ran it a few years back ([Jordi’s
Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/1846802289)) -  still the only
evidence found of a finish on the route is his 2018 finish in 6:38. Running from
the Sunnyvale Mountain TH (south end) to the Kings Mountain Fire Station (north
end), this 34 mile route follows trails crossing over and back along Skyline
Boulevard. It hits classic trails like the Skyline Trail, Saratoga Gap Trail and
the Bay Area Ridge Trail, and runs through State Parks and Open Space Preserves
such as Castle Rock, Long Ridge, Skyline Ridge, Russian Ridge, Windy Hill,
Wunderlich and others. Though it does have a few road sections, the longest one
being from mile 22-25, the route overall seems to be a great mix of fireroad,
single track and road. With supposedly 8000ft of climbing and almost 9000ft of
descent. Could be a doozy. Heres the [GAIA link for your gpx
desires](https://www.gaiagps.com/public/XZnroqUhfnKb0Zc5cO4N5GbV).

P.S. We’ll proceed with the statement that the only evidence we have of someone
doing the whole route is Jordi’s Strava run above, but that means this one could
be even more of an adventure. We’re not going to get too sticky if people
accidentally run on parallel trails (just don’t rip the piss too much and take
the 35 the whole way). And as far as I can see, all of this route is either
public parks or road. Please correct me if you see something amiss.

**Start Location:** The South Bay Skyline route begins at the Sunnyvale Mountain TH and finished at the Kings Mountain Fire Station<br>
**Distance:** 34 miles<br>
**Elevation Gain:** ~6000-8000ft
