Some of the toughest climbs are the runnable ones. This route starts on slightly
climbing single track through woods and chaparral, but for the final mile, it
grinds you up the steepest section of fire road. You’ll enjoy sweeping vistas of
the South Bay and up the peninsula to San Francisco, if you’re still
lucid.

As it stands, Megan Roche (45:57) and Lucas Matison (40:41) hold the CRs for the
Black Mountain hill climb via Rhus Ridge
([Strava](https://www.strava.com/segments/1495278), [All
Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/black-mountain-via-rhus-ridge)).

**Start Location:** At the TH parking lot on Rhus Ridge Road, by the Caretaker’s residence<br>
**Distance:** 4.8 miles<br>
**Elevation Gain:** ~2700ft
